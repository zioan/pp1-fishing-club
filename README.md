# Apen Fishing Club
[live project on Github](https://zioan.github.io/pp1-fishing-club/)

## Project Description
Apen Fishing Club is, as the name suggests, a website for a fishing club that gives a brief overview of the club and its members.

Users of this website can find out more about the club's history, membership plans and requirements, a short gallery of reviews and media content from other members, as well as a contact form for interested users to get in touch with the club. The website has been created using the responsive-first concept and is responsive on all screen sizes.

## Overview
  - This website is structured as a single-page website with four sections (Home, Membership, Gallery and Contact).

## Features
### Menu Navigation
  - It is located at the top of the website.
  - It has a fixed position at the top, ensuring that users have access to the menu at all times.
  - On small screens, when the navigation links do not fit in a single row, the menu transforms into a "hamburger" menu (a compact menu icon that expands to show the full menu when clicked).

  - It contains a Hero image showing an angler at a beautiful lake and a text overlay with the website headline.
  - It contains an About section in which the user can catch up on the history of the club.

### Contact Section
  - It contains an engaging message for the user to contact the club in any manner (email, phone, direct message via the contact form or in person to the club address).
  - It contains an address sub-section where the user can compose an email or initiate a call directly from their device.
  - It contains a contact form in which the user must enter their first and last name, their e-mail address, and the message to be sent to the Club. There is an optional phone field and, if the user is already a member, a field for the membership ID.
